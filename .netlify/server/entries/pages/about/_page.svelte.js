			the path of becoming a software engineer where there is no shortage of challenges. So far,
			JavaScript has been my weapon of choice. I&#39;ve had the fortune of being able to write a lot of
			code for 8-9 figure companies over the past few years. I&#39;ve contributed to platforms for
			e-commerce, big data, internal tools, and marketing websites.</p> <h4>How I Think About Software</h4> <p>My thoughts around software center around collaboration. I try to write the most simple,
			clean, and extendible code possible. I always write for the next person that will work on it.
			For me, there is nothing more critical than keeping code easy to read and easy to change.</p> <h4>Outside Of Work</h4> <p>I am a dad and husband, the rest of the things in life are secondary to me. My love for
			optimizing has followed me into my personal life as well. I enjoy taking in books, podcasts,
			weight lifting, finance, investing, and cooking. Whenever possible, I also enjoy helping
			others through tutoring and mentoring.</p> <p><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/182556.Stephen_Studer_Top_Reads">Favorite Books List</a></p></div></main>`;
