    <h2>Notable Work Projects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Architected a headless CDP and associated pattern library of reusable branded components.
        Reached MVP in 6 months. Built a feature that took an existing 7-9 day process for an
        adjacent team and reduced it to 45 minutes, resulting in millions of dollars of projected
        revenue.
      </li>
      <li>
        Led a full TypeScript conversion of a 100,000 line codebase. This included ideation,
        planning, team ramp-up planning, and execution. The conversion was completed in 6 months.
      </li>
      <li>
        Multiple pattern library projects. I have built 2, and contributed to a large scale
        refactoring that implemented the patterns, across a 250,000 line codebase.
      </li>
      <li>
        Contributed to an existing pattern library and refactored an existing 250,000 line codebase
        to use each of the defined patterns.
      </li>
      <li>
        Several software integrations with outside vendors, making each instance seamless in the
        target application.
      </li>
      <li>
        Several large scale updates include vue 2 to vue 3, JavaScript to TypeScript in a stepwise
        fashion, Foundation to Tailwind.
      </li>
    </ul>
