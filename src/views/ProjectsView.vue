      <h2>Vue Todo's and Pomodoro Timer</h2>
      <p>
        This project started as my first vue project and has gone through
        several iterations. It was converted from a code tutorial, to something
        customized to be my own, to its current iteration of vue 3 and vite.
      </p>

        It contains an about page that outlines the changes it has gone through,
        it is my go to project for testing architecture changes in vue.js.
