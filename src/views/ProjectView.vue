      <h4>Pomodoro Tasks</h4>
      <p>
        This project started as my first vue project and has gone through several iterations. It was
        converted from a code tutorial, to something customized to be my own, to its current
        iteration of vue 3 and vite, several css frameworks/libraries. If I need to test out some
        conversion for work I will usually do it here first as a test.

    <h4>Personal Blog Site</h4>
    <p>
      This is a less formal blog site that I maintain as documentation of things I learn along the
      way and tracking of accomplishments. It is very simply written in HTML and CSS.

    <h4>Mentorship</h4>
    <p>
      Not a project per se, but I have been involved in mentoring several developers over the years
      both personally and as a TA for a coding bootcamp. Most recently helping a mentee go from
      being interested but little-to-no experience in web development to landing a job as a full
      stack developer that he has been at for over a year now.
