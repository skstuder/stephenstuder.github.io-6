        <li>
          Architected a headless CDP and associated pattern library of reusable branded components.
          Reached MVP in 6 months. Built a feature that took an existing 7-9 day process for an
          adjacent team and reduced it to 45 minutes, resulting in millions of dollars of projected
          revenue.
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
          Contributed to an existing pattern library and refactored an existing 250,000 line
          codebase to use each of the defined patterns.
        </li>
        <li>
          Several software integrations with outside vendors, making each instance seamless in the
          target application.
        </li>
        <li>
          Several large scale updates include vue 2 to vue 3, JavaScript to TypeScript in a stepwise

      <h2>Personal Toy Projects</h2>
      <h4>Pomodoro Tasks</h4>
      <p>
        This project started as my first vue project and has gone through several iterations. It was
        converted from a code tutorial, to something customized to be my own, to its current
        iteration of vue 3 and vite, several css frameworks/libraries. If I need to test out some
        conversion for work I will usually do it here first as a test.

    <h4>Mentorship</h4>
    <p>
      Not a project per se, but I have been involved in mentoring several developers over the years
      both personally and as a TA for a coding bootcamp. Most recently helping a mentee go from
      being interested but little-to-no experience in web development to landing a job as a full
      stack developer that he has been at for over a year now.
