      <h2>About me</h2>
      <h4>My Career So Far</h4>
      <p>
       I have always had a passion for figuring difficult things out and improving. That passion ultimately led me down the path of becoming a software developer where fortunately
       there is no shortage of challenges. JavaScript has been my weapon of choice, I've written a lot of code for 8-9 figure companies, working on various e-commerce platforms, big data tools, pattern 
       libraries. 
      </p>
      <h4>How I Think About Software</h4>
      <p>
       My thoughts around software center around collaboration. I try to write the most simple, clean and extendible code possible. I always write for 
       the next person working on it and have cycled through the software development lifecycle enough times now to understand the value of keeping
       code easy to read and easy to change.
      </p>
      <h4>Outside Of Work</h4>
      <p>First and foremost, I am a dad and husband, the rest of the things in life are secondary to me. My love for optimizing has definitely followed me into my 
        personal life where I enjoy taking in books, podcasts, weight lifting, finance and investing, and cooking. I also have a passion for teaching and enjoy helping others through 
        tutoring and mentoring.
