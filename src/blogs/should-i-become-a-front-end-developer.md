## For Beginners: Should I become a front-end developer?

12/01/2022

I am very fortunate to have a career in software development be my perfect career match. I wake up ready to solve problems and learn, I am charged up each day. Some days I have a hard time stopping my work. Very often, I have have people ask me if I think the career might be a good fit for them as well. I decided to lay out some of the questions that cross my mind when asked this question below:

### Are you the type of person that will not stop until you figure something out?

- For example, your microwave stops working. Do you shrug it off, or do you get to work? Google searches, testing theories, on and off again, calling a handy resource, calling the manufacturer. One way or another fixing the damn microwave if it's the last thing you do.

### When you get something new, are you super excited to understand the ins and outs of how it works?

- Do you show others around you how to use it?
- Do you like instructions?

### Are you open to criticism?

- If I asked you a question and you didn't know the answer how would you respond?
- In software engineering, your work gets torn to shreds daily. You will never know it all, it's not possible. Can your ego handle this?
- Do you love getting told how you could do better? Do you get excited when someone who knows more than you gives you advice?
- I get excited when my teammates find ways to do things better in my code. Because I become better as a result of learning where I fell short. There is always someone smarter than you and the structure of software teams will surround you with these people. If you try to pretend you know it all they will sniff you out a mile away. Learn from them.

### Can you communicate your ideas?

- Can you explain to a child how something complex works in a way they can grasp?
- Are you comfortable describing a problem to a group and getting asked questions about it?

### Do you like to make things?

- Exercise: in youtube search 'HTML CSS website for beginners. Follow step by step making an example project. Then once the tutorial is over, change the project entirely. Add your own sections, styles, pictures, and layout. Make it entirely different from the example project. Break it. Fix it. Was this fun for you? It is extremely fun for web developers, so be honest with yourself.

### Can you handle constant change?

- You will get pulled to different projects and app areas.
- Do you like to start anew, to drop everything, a blank canvas?
- There are plenty of jobs in tech where you can do something repetitive, this is not one of them.

### Do you like tips and tricks? Hacks? Cool new ways of doing things?

- Do you get excited about learning a new way to cut an onion faster?
- Automating your bank accounts, is that fun for you?
- What I am trying to say is, are you an optimizer?

### In a plain sense, do you understand that some websites are better than others?

- Have you ever tried considering why? I'm not asking that you understand the intricacies of every site you visit. But if you cannot tell that a crappy site is crappy, or a great site is great, you will struggle.

### Finally, are you a learn-it-all.

- Are you drawn by a constant desire to figure stuff out?
- Do you want to make the perfect margarita for a party rather than a mix?
- Does learning how to decide what investments to choose in your 401k excite you?
- There is no shortage of learning in this career path. If you aren't excited to check out new technologies, figure out how you can write your software better, learn new patterns, to read blog posts you will fall behind. This industry moves, and you have to keep up.

There's a start! If you made it this far we can say you are curious which is an excellent trait for front-end developers. Keep going! Read blog posts, look up courses, consider a boot camp, and build something!
