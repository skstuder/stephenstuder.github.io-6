		<h2>About me</h2>
		<h4>My Career So Far</h4>
		<p>
			I have always had a passion for figuring difficult things out and improving. This led me down
			the path of becoming a software engineer where there is no shortage of challenges. I've
			developed a specialty in front end development usually working closely with backend
			developers. I've had the fortune of being able to write a lot of code for 8-9 figure companies
			over the past few years. I've contributed to platforms for e-commerce, big data, internal
			tools, and marketing websites.
		</p>
		<h4>How I Think About Software</h4>
		<p>
			My thoughts around software center around collaboration. I try to write the most simple,
			clean, and extendible code possible. I always write for the next person that will work on it.
			For me, there is nothing more critical than keeping code easy to read and easy to change.
			Having worked on many projects in a variety of technologies I have a unique perspective on
			design tradeoffs and how to make the best decisions for the project. My strengths are in
			JavaScript and Vue.js, but I have also worked with React, Angular, and Node.js.
		</p>
		<h4>How I Think About User Interfaces</h4>
		<p>
			I try to make the interface as simple as possible using standard and proven practices in the
			UI design space that also account for current trends. Accessibility is also top of mind, so
			that applications can be used by as many people as possible. I have worked in B2B and B2C
			environments, which contain their own unique considerations. Ultimately, good design should be
			invisible, and the user should be able to accomplish their goal with as little friction as
			possible.
