			>* Honestly, I don't really work on personal projects. Work keeps me very occupied. When I
			have spare time I prefer to read blog posts or books about development for ideas I can use at
			work. But below are a few projects I have done in the past.

		<h2>Vue Todo's and Pomodoro Timer</h2>
		<p>
			This project started as my first vue project and has gone through several iterations. It was
			converted from a code tutorial, to something customized to be my own, to its current iteration
			of vue 3 and vite.
		</p>
		<p>
			It contains an about page that outlines the changes it has gone through, it is my go to
			project for testing architecture changes in vue.js.
